# Welcome to my Trading Book

This book will cover information neccesarry for algorithmic trading.  While I believe all content is critical, correct, and 
relevant it should be noted that I am not a Quant and do not do this professionally. I am a professional data scientist and
do professionally analyze data and create models, and as I learn about this specific domain I am writing the book I wish existed.  
I hope others benefit from it.


I hope you enjoy the book and would appreciate any feedback!
