# Welcome to my Trading Book

## About this Book

This book is written to be the book we wish we had as we started to learn about quantititive trading.  We wanted a book that would follow a project first approach and shows how ideas can take many forms throughout the course of that project.  Courses and books often do show good solutions on clean data that are carefully prepared so they work out nicely.  Unfortunately, that's not how it works out in reality.  The reality is that once you have an idea, it takes lots of testing, iterating, and trial and error to figure out which (if any) of your ideas are worth pursuing.

Our goal is to show how to think about problems the "right" way, not provide every fact you will need to know.  This means our focus is not on covering all terminology or be a complete/exhaustive resource - you will never know it all.  But you can learn how to approach projects in a way that allows you to learn what you need when you need it.

It was written in this way for two reasons:
+ We believe in learning by doing.  There is only so much you can learn from reading - my hope is that these give you a good reference in what you should be doing on your own.
+ We believe in writing to learn.  As we write this book and tutorial we learn and solidify my own knowledge.

## Prerequisites

+ No finance or algorithmic trading knowledge needed!  This book assumes no knowledge in these areas.
+ This book assumes python expertise.  The entire book uses the python programming language and we do not explain or teach python programming content.  We are however happy to answer questions and help people along - feel free to communicate to us on github!

## How this book should be used

Reading this book should be an active activity.  Open the chapters in colab or binder to follow along!  Play with the code, look at shapes of things and try different parameters.  If something doesn't make sense, play with it until it does.

After completing a chapter, you should do a similar project on your own dataset while referencing the book as little as possible.  A good first step is switching out the dataset to your own dataset.  A good next step is coming up with a variation or experiment not tried in the book to add.

We hope you enjoy the book and would appreciate any feedback or comments!
